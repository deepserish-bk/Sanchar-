# Sanchar

Simple, private, end-to-end encrypted file sharing — built for real people.

## Why I built this
I wanted to build a file sharing platform that adhered to the CIA triad of cybersecurity.  
Most use Gmail or WeTransfer and accidentally break GDPR.  
Sanchar fixes that — and works for anyone who needs to send sensitive files safely.

## Features (being built live)
- Drag & drop files
- Military-grade encryption (age / X25519)
- Links expire automatically
- Password never travels with the link
- English • Italiano • नेपाली
